BattleWars but experimenting with SpriteKit

This is a very old app of mine that was basically just some fun.
You have things flying at you that you need to shoot, with pokemon music going on in the background.

It uses SpriteKit and is a modification of a demo that I followed (sorry I have lost it).


I don't own the Pokemon Theme Song or the images presented in this app.
